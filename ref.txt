See slides IITB-ASR for OpenFST commands
Visualise FST : fstdraw HCLG.fst | dot -Tpdf > A.pdf

Idea :
The fst files are created based on phones.txt and words.txt as the input symbol tables. Basically each phone and word is mapped to integer id values and used in the FST. Can check the L.fst and G.fst rendered as pdfs to see the input and output mappings from phones to words and to the language model.
